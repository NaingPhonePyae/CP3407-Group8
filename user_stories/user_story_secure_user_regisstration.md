# Secure User Registration and Login

As a user, I want to register and log in securely so that I can access my personalized dashboard and manage bookings safely. This involves creating an account with email and password, verifying the email address, logging in through a secure form, and redirecting the user to a role-specific dashboard (customer or provider). Security measures such as HTTPS and token-based sessions will be used.
