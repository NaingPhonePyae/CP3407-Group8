# User story title: Manage Booking Calendar

As a cleaning service provider, I want to manage my booking calendar so that I can keep track of appointments and availability. This includes displaying an interactive calendar, syncing with available time slots, blocking unavailable periods, and optionally integrating with external services like Google Calendar. The system ensures that bookings are accepted only within set business hours.
