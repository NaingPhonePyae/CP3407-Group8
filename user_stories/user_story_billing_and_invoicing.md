# Billing and Invoicing
As a cleaning service provider, I want the cleaning booking system to support billing and 
invoicing functionalities so that we can offer more convenient payment methods to customers. 
This involves collecting billing details, creating invoices for services provided, and keeping 
track of payment history.

## Priority: High


## Estimation: 3 days
Estimated before iteration 1:
* Min Khant: 1 days
* Khun Pyae Heinn: 2 days
* Naing Phone Pyae: 3 days
* Nang Kaung Shan Kham: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):
* One payment gateway (e.g., Paynow or PayPal) is already selected and will be integrated.
* Each invoice will be auto-generated after a completed service.
* All service prices are fixed and tax-inclusive (if applicable).
* Customer billing data is stored securely and in compliance with data protection laws.

## Description: 
The web site will allow payment through online for the cleaning services.
