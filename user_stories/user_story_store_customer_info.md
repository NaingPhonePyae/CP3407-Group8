# Store Customer Information in Database
As a cleaning service provider, I want the cleaning booking system to store and manage customer 
information securely in a database so that we can reach out to them immediately. This involves 
collecting personal details, addresses, preferences (if applicable), and contact information. 
The system should ensure data accuracy and allow easy retrieval and updating of customer records.
